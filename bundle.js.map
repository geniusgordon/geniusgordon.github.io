從 javascript 裡拉出來</p>\\n<p>因為就像前面提到的，這樣在 javascript 執行之前就可以看到樣式了</p>\\n<p>像是 webpack 有一個插件 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin\\\">extract-text-webpack-plugin</a></p>\\n<p>他會把所有的 `import styles from ‘./styles.css’ 集合起來存成一個檔案</p>\\n<p>另外各種 CSS in JS

styled-components 一開始沒對 SSR 做處理</p>\\n<p>所以頁面載入時就會先渲染他有 extract 到的一些基本樣式</p>\\n<p>然後在 javascript 跑起來之後 React 才會把剩下的樣式加進去</p>\\n<p>解決方式就是上一個段落講的那樣</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 635 */\n/***/

href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/\\\">unixporn</a>，看看大家都怎麼客製化自己的 linux dekstop</p>\\n<p>發現很多人都會用 <a href=\\\"https://i3wm.org/\\\">i3</a> - 一個視窗管理神器</p>\\n<p>最近想說來用看看，不用還好，用了直接進入了 Linux Geek 的新境界</p>\\n<!--more-->\\n<h2>Window Manager</h2>\\n<p>i3 是一種 window manager，先來介紹一下 window manager 是什麼</p>\\n<p>Window manager 簡稱 wm，就跟字面上的意思一樣是負責管理視窗的東西，主要可以分成兩種</p>\\n<p><strong>Compositing Window Manager</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/eKEZkV8.png\\\" alt=\\\"Messy Desktop\\\"></p>\\n<p>常見的視窗管理都是這類的，桌面像桌子，視窗像紙一樣重疊擺在桌上</p>\\n<p><strong>Tiling Window Manager</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/f3ccPE5.png\\\" alt=\\\"Oranized drawer\\\"></p>\\n<p>Tiling window manager 不重疊視窗，把畫面分成一格一格的，比較像桌子的抽屜</p>\\n<h2>Why Tiling Window Manager?</h2>\\n<p>寫程式的人常常需要一邊開編輯器一邊開瀏覽器查東西，可能還要開很多有的沒有的東西</p>\\n<p>像我在寫 react-native 的時候就需要開</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Android emulator</li>\\n<li>Chrome</li>\\n<li>一個 Terminal 開 vim、一個 dev server、一個看 log</li>\\n<li>有時候可能還要開一個 Redux Debugger</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>如果在加上一些通訊軟體 (Messenger、Line、Telegram、Slack)</p>\\n<p>視窗一多，桌面的視窗很容易就變的亂亂的</p>\\n<p>雖然 terminal 的部分可以用 tmux 處理</p>\\n<p>gnome 也有 workspace 可以開多個桌面</p>\\n<p>但是傳統的 window manager 常常會需要自己移動跟縮放視窗避免他們擋到別人</p>\\n<p>有時候還是會覺得用起來卡卡的</p>\\n<p>Tiling window manager 就可以很輕鬆的排版視窗，然後用各種快截鍵做高效率的操作</p>\\n<p>用起來大概就像最上面那張圖一樣</p>\\n<h2>i3</h2>\\n<p>我第一個接觸的 tiling wm，其他的還沒試過，無法做比較</p>\\n<p>分享一下自己的<a href=\\\"https://github.com/geniusgordon/dotfiles\\\">設定</a>跟客製化的東西</p>\\n<p>很多都是參考 unixporn 上面分享的，目前還在持續改進中</p>\\n<h2>Status bar</h2>\\n<p>i3 的 status bar 用了他自己的 <a href=\\\"https://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html\\\">i3bar protocol</a></p>\\n<p>做法是在 i3 config 裡設定</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\">bar </span>{\\n  status_command <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">&lt;command&gt;</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>那個 command 要 output 一個 infinite json array, 最簡單的例子如下</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-json\\\">[\\n  [{<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\" 17: 10\\\"</span>}, {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"  89%\\\"</span>}],\\n  [{<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\" 17: 11\\\"</span>}, {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"  88%\\\"</span>}],\\n  [{<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\" 17: 12\\\"</span>}, {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"  87%\\\"</span>}],\\n  ...\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>他就會把他顯示在 status bar 上</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/pfBri9v.png\\\" alt=\\\"i3bar example\\\"></p>\\n<p>所以可以自己寫一個 script，寫任何你想要顯示在 status bar 上面的東西</p>\\n<p>我用了 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks\\\">i3blocks</a> 來輔助設定，他可以搭配一個 config file，比較好管理自己寫的 script</p>\\n<p>我的目前長這樣，還滿普通的</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/bMwz9Fi.png\\\" alt=\\\"i3blocks\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Notification</h2>\\n<p>用了 i3 就不會有像 Gnome, Ubuntu Unity 那種預設的通知泡泡</p>\\n<p>雖然沒有別人幫你做好的東西，要自己設定，但這是缺點也是優點，就是可以自由的客製化</p>\\n<p>我用的是 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst\\\">dunst</a>，他滿容易設定的，目前長這樣，也是滿普通的</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/l1gQKyp.png\\\" alt=\\\"dunst\\\"></p>\\n<p>還有一些 icon 問題沒處理，像上面這個 telegram 就只有顯示系統預設的 icon</p>\\n<h2>Lock Screen</h2>\\n<p>這個我還沒設定完，目前在用 i3 官方的 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/i3/i3lock\\\">i3lock</a></p>\\n<p>我還有看到一些別人擴充 i3lock 做的東西，像是 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy\\\">i3lock-fancy</a> 把桌面變模糊來當背景</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy/master/screenshot.png\\\" alt=\\\"i3lock-fancy\\\"></p>\\n<p>不過他的 script 跑的有點慢，我就沒用了</p>\\n<h2>結語</h2>\\n<p>我覺得 i3 跟 arch linux 還有 vim 有點像，都是不好上手，但是用了之後會很爽</p>\\n<p>入坑 i3，又 Geek 了一個階層呢</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ },\n/* 638 */\n/***/

從 javascript 裡拉出來</p>\\n<p>因為就像前面提到的，這樣在 javascript 執行之前就可以看到樣式了</p>\\n<p>像是 webpack 有一個插件 <a

styled-components 一開始沒對 SSR 做處理</p>\\n<p>所以頁面載入時就會先渲染他有 extract 到的一些基本樣式</p>\\n<p>然後在 javascript 跑起來之後 React 才會把剩下的樣式加進去</p>\\n<p>解決方式就是上一個段落講的那樣</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n//

JS</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/src\\\">AMP JS library</a> 裡面實做了各種 <a href=\\\"https://www.ampproject.org/learn/how-amp-works/\\\">AMP 加速的方法</a></p>\\n<p>像是 lazy-loaded resources</p>\\n<p>如果用了 <code>&lt;amp-img&gt;</code> 他只會先抓使用者可見範圍裡面的圖</p>\\n<p>這樣可以用最快的時間產生最少需要的畫面</p>\\n<p>讓使用者感受到更少的畫面延遲</p>\\n<h3>Google AMP Cache</h3>\\n<p>看到 Cache 這個字就是跟快有關係</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/\\\">Google AMP Cache</a> 會把合格的 AMP 網頁用 cdn 的方式存起來</p>\\n<p>總之就是更快</p>\\n<h3>AMP-ify</h3>\\n<p>看完 AMP 的介紹之後就是要動手把自己的 Blog AMP-ify 一下</p>\\n<p>Google 了一下發現 Gatsby 社群裡有人已經寫了一個小小的 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/chiedo/gatsby-amp-starter-blog/blob/master/ampify.js\\\">script</a> 把網頁轉 AMP</p>\\n<p>我就拿來做了一點小修改 (<code>amp-img</code> 的 layout 跟 <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> 的連結)</p>\\n<p>然後套用在自己的 Blog</p>\\n<p>大概經過半小時的努力</p>\\n<p>終於讓我的 Blog 在 Google Search 的時候也會有潮潮的閃電啦</p>\\n<p><img

QQ</p>\\n<p>來分享一下最近在 Archlinux 上調教字體的小小心得</p>\\n<p>主要是設定 powerline 以及 emoji</p>\\n<!--more-->\\n<h2>Powerline</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://github.com/powerline/powerline\\\">Powerline</a> 是一個很炫的 theme</p>\\n<p>常用在各種 shell 的 prompt 還有 vim, tmux 的 statusline</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/NwdBdcK.png\\\" alt=\\\"powerline\\\"></p>\\n<p>其中那些三角型都是 unicode 字元    </p>\\n<p>很容易出現字體不支援的狀況</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/lfWR5f4.png\\\" alt=\\\"no-powerline\\\"></p>\\n<p>很多人的做法都是去做字體檔的<a href=\\\"https://github.com/powerline/fonts\\\">補丁</a></p>\\n<p>如果用的是不常見的字體沒人幫做補丁就會很困擾</p>\\n<p>但我發現那個 repo 裡有一個只包含那些字元的字體 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/powerline/powerline/tree/master/font\\\">PowerlineSymbols</a></p>\\n<p>如果系統有自己處理字型 fallback 的話應該就能正常顯示了</p>\\n<p>這樣就可以自由使用任何字體 + Powerline 了</p>\\n<p>如果沒有的話可以參考下面的 Fontconfig</p>\\n<h2>Fontconfig</h2>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/\\\">Fontconfig</a> 是一個設定字體的庫</p>\\n<p>大部分現代 Linux 裡的應用都是用這個庫來選擇及渲染字體的</p>\\n<p>他可以設定系統裡襯線、無襯線、等寬的預設字型</p>\\n<p>還可以在系統匹配字體時插入別的字體 <em>(ex: emoji)</em></p>\\n<h3>Font Path</h3>\\n<p>fontconfig 預設會在這兩個目錄底下搜尋字體檔</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>/usr/share/fonts/</li>\\n<li>~/.local/share/fonts</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>可以用 <code>fc-list</code> 這個指令來查看系統中安裝了哪些字體</p>\\n<h3>Fontconfig configuration</h3>\\n<p>fontconfig 主要從以下幾個路徑搜尋設定檔</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>/etc/fonts/fonts.conf</li>\\n<li>/etc/fonts/conf.d/</li>\\n<li>~/.fonts.conf</li>\\n<li>~/.fonts.conf.d/</li>\\n<li>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf</li>\\n<li>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/conf.d/</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> 是存放使用者各種設定的目錄，預設為 <code>~/.config</code></em></p>\\n<p><em>Arch Wiki 說 fontconfig 2.10.1 以後 <code>~/.fonts.conf</code> 跟 <code>~/.fonts.conf</code> deprecated 了</em></p>\\n<p>Fontconfig 的設定檔使用 xml 的格式</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">&lt;!-- fontconfig template --&gt;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"php\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-meta\\\">&lt;?</span>xml

--&gt;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">fontconfig</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>詳細的文件可以用 <code>man fonts-conf</code> 來查看</p>\\n<p>這邊分享一下<a href=\\\"https://github.com/geniusgordon/dotfiles/blob/master/fonts.conf\\\">我自己的設定</a></p>\\n<p>主要是拿來設定 emoji 的</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-xml\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span

class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;/<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">match</span>&gt;</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>這段設定的意思是</p>\\n<p>當我要使用無襯線字體 (sans-serif) 的時候</p>\\n<p>在前面插入 (prepend) Noto Color Emoji</p>\\n<p>有點像 css 在設定 font-family</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-css\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">font-family</span>: \\\"<span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">Noto</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">Color</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">Emoji</span>\\\", <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">sans-serif</span>;\\n              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n      在 <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">sans-serif</span> 前插入 <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">Noto</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">Color</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-selector-tag\\\">Emoji</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>這樣一來不管在什麼地方使用到 emoji</p>\\n<p>系統都會優先使用 Noto Color Emoji 來渲染</p>\\n<h2>Color Emoji in Terminal</h2>\\n<p>Linux 裡面常見的 terminal 預設都不支援有顏色的 emoji</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/SZIGEOQ.png\\\" alt=\\\"no-color\\\"></p>\\n<p>後來我在 SO 看到<a

href=\\\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/\\\">unixporn</a>，看看大家都怎麼客製化自己的 linux dekstop</p>\\n<p>發現很多人都會用 <a href=\\\"https://i3wm.org/\\\">i3</a> - 一個視窗管理神器</p>\\n<p>最近想說來用看看，不用還好，用了直接進入了 Linux Geek 的新境界</p>\\n<!--more-->\\n<h2>Window Manager</h2>\\n<p>i3 是一種 window manager，先來介紹一下 window manager 是什麼</p>\\n<p>Window manager 簡稱 wm，就跟字面上的意思一樣是負責管理視窗的東西，主要可以分成兩種</p>\\n<p><strong>Compositing Window Manager</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/eKEZkV8.png\\\" alt=\\\"Messy Desktop\\\"></p>\\n<p>常見的視窗管理都是這類的，桌面像桌子，視窗像紙一樣重疊擺在桌上</p>\\n<p><strong>Tiling Window Manager</strong></p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/f3ccPE5.png\\\" alt=\\\"Oranized drawer\\\"></p>\\n<p>Tiling window manager 不重疊視窗，把畫面分成一格一格的，比較像桌子的抽屜</p>\\n<h2>Why Tiling Window Manager?</h2>\\n<p>寫程式的人常常需要一邊開編輯器一邊開瀏覽器查東西，可能還要開很多有的沒有的東西</p>\\n<p>像我在寫 react-native 的時候就需要開</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Android emulator</li>\\n<li>Chrome</li>\\n<li>一個 Terminal 開 vim、一個 dev server、一個看 log</li>\\n<li>有時候可能還要開一個 Redux Debugger</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>如果在加上一些通訊軟體 (Messenger、Line、Telegram、Slack)</p>\\n<p>視窗一多，桌面的視窗很容易就變的亂亂的</p>\\n<p>雖然 terminal 的部分可以用 tmux 處理</p>\\n<p>gnome 也有 workspace 可以開多個桌面</p>\\n<p>但是傳統的 window manager 常常會需要自己移動跟縮放視窗避免他們擋到別人</p>\\n<p>有時候還是會覺得用起來卡卡的</p>\\n<p>Tiling window manager 就可以很輕鬆的排版視窗，然後用各種快截鍵做高效率的操作</p>\\n<p>用起來大概就像最上面那張圖一樣</p>\\n<h2>i3</h2>\\n<p>我第一個接觸的 tiling wm，其他的還沒試過，無法做比較</p>\\n<p>分享一下自己的<a href=\\\"https://github.com/geniusgordon/dotfiles\\\">設定</a>跟客製化的東西</p>\\n<p>很多都是參考 unixporn 上面分享的，目前還在持續改進中</p>\\n<h2>Status bar</h2>\\n<p>i3 的 status bar 用了他自己的 <a href=\\\"https://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html\\\">i3bar protocol</a></p>\\n<p>做法是在 i3 config 裡設定</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-class\\\">bar </span>{\\n  status_command <span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">&lt;command&gt;</span>\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>那個 command 要 output 一個 infinite json array, 最簡單的例子如下</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-json\\\">[\\n  [{<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\" 17: 10\\\"</span>}, {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"  89%\\\"</span>}],\\n  [{<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\" 17: 11\\\"</span>}, {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"  88%\\\"</span>}],\\n  [{<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\" 17: 12\\\"</span>}, {<span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"full_text\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"  87%\\\"</span>}],\\n  ...\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>他就會把他顯示在 status bar 上</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/pfBri9v.png\\\" alt=\\\"i3bar example\\\"></p>\\n<p>所以可以自己寫一個 script，寫任何你想要顯示在 status bar 上面的東西</p>\\n<p>我用了 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks\\\">i3blocks</a> 來輔助設定，他可以搭配一個 config file，比較好管理自己寫的 script</p>\\n<p>我的目前長這樣，還滿普通的</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/bMwz9Fi.png\\\" alt=\\\"i3blocks\\\"></p>\\n<h2>Notification</h2>\\n<p>用了 i3 就不會有像 Gnome, Ubuntu Unity 那種預設的通知泡泡</p>\\n<p>雖然沒有別人幫你做好的東西，要自己設定，但這是缺點也是優點，就是可以自由的客製化</p>\\n<p>我用的是 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst\\\">dunst</a>，他滿容易設定的，目前長這樣，也是滿普通的</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://i.imgur.com/l1gQKyp.png\\\" alt=\\\"dunst\\\"></p>\\n<p>還有一些 icon 問題沒處理，像上面這個 telegram 就只有顯示系統預設的 icon</p>\\n<h2>Lock Screen</h2>\\n<p>這個我還沒設定完，目前在用 i3 官方的 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/i3/i3lock\\\">i3lock</a></p>\\n<p>我還有看到一些別人擴充 i3lock 做的東西，像是 <a href=\\\"https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy\\\">i3lock-fancy</a> 把桌面變模糊來當背景</p>\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy/master/screenshot.png\\\" alt=\\\"i3lock-fancy\\\"></p>\\n<p>不過他的 script 跑的有點慢，我就沒用了</p>\\n<h2>結語</h2>\\n<p>我覺得 i3 跟 arch linux 還有 vim 有點像，都是不好上手，但是用了之後會很爽</p>\\n<p>入坑 i3，又 Geek 了一個階層呢</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n//
